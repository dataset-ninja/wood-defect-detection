**Supporting data for Deep Learning and Machine Vision based approaches for automated wood defect detection and quality control** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the wood and manufacturing industries, and in the computer aided quality control domain. 

The dataset consists of 20276 images with 86803 labeled objects belonging to 10 different classes including *Live_knot*, *Death_know*, *resin*, and other: *knot_with_crack*, *Crack*, *Marrow*, *Quartzity*, *Knot_missing*, *Blue_stain*, and *overgrown*.

Images in the Wood Defect Detection dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). There are 1991 (10% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the VSB TUO, Czech Republic.
