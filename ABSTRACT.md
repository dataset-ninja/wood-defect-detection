The authors of the **Wood Defect Detection** dataset address the multifaceted challenges faced by the wood industry. They highlight the significant variability in raw materials and the intricate manufacturing processes, leading to a diverse range of observable structural defects. These defects require assessment by trained specialists through manual processes that are laborious, subject to bias, and less efficient. To enhance quality control procedures, automated vision-based systems have been proposed. Despite some studies achieving higher recognition rates compared to trained experts, a shortage of extensive databases and genuine data in this domain has impeded research progress. To remedy this issue, the authors conducted a data acquisition experiment within an industrial setting, acquiring a comprehensive set of authentic data from a production line.

The authors introduce a substantial dataset containing high-resolution images of sawn timber surfaces. This dataset encompasses over 43,000 labeled surface defects, covering ten common types of wood defects. They provide two types of labels for each image record, enabling researchers to perform semantic segmentation, defect classification, and localization. The wood industry's manufacturing processes influence material utilization and cost efficiency. The complexity and variability of wood materials can result in various defects, affecting both mechanical properties and aesthetic value. Despite increasing automation, many companies rely on trained domain experts for quality grading, with manual inspection often limited by volume and subject to human-related factors. To address this, the authors aim to develop accurate automated systems.

The authors constructed a laboratory setup comprising a conveyor belt, light source, and line scan camera. The camera captured images at a speed of 4 m/s, synchronized with the conveyor belt's movement. This experiment involved 250 wood veneers, each scanned at a resolution of 4,000 Ã— 3,000 pixels. The resulting dataset contained 4,729 usable images, of which 353 had wood defects. To address the lack of extensive databases in this field, the authors performed an experiment in an industrial environment to acquire authentic data from the production line. To overcome challenges such as high-speed conveyor belts and vibrations, they developed both hardware and software solutions for high-resolution image acquisition. To ensure high-quality images at a speed of 9.6 m/s, the authors employed a trilinear line scan camera and a high-performance Camera Link frame grabber.

Annotation was performed manually, with the authors developing a customizable annotation tool to streamline the process. They created BMP files representing semantic maps of labeled defects, with each zone painted in an image corresponding to a specific defect. The annotation tool automatically generated coordinates for bounding boxes and labels. This large-scale dataset and associated labeling offer a valuable resource for advancing automated wood defect detection and quality control systems.
